        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">What time to arrive on this earth! World War Two had just erupted in September 1939, plunging the world into chaos and uncertainty. As the United Kingdom was reluctantly drawn into another global conflict, families across the nation faced the grim reality of separation, sacrifice, and survival. Amidst the turmoil of war, amidst the echoes of distant battles and the shadows of impending danger, a new life entered the world, destined to navigate the challenges and opportunities of a tumultuous era.<br/><br/>
        On my arrival, I joined my <a href="images/dadmum.jpg">my Mother & Father</a> and three brothers: Michael, born in 1933; Lionel, in 1934; and David, in 1936. According to my birth certificate, my father's occupation was listed as a "Businessman," a title that conjures up all sorts of images of success, power, and ambition. However, as I grew older and came to know him better, I discovered that he was much more than that. He was a lovable, kind-hearted man, adored by all who knew him. With his infectious charm and the gift of gab, he could light up any room and make even the most mundane moments memorable. Despite facing the challenges of being of the Jewish faith, he carried himself with dignity and resilience, embodying the values of compassion and perseverance. Unfortunately, he passed away in September 1951 when I was only eleven years old. But in all the time I spent with him, he taught me the value of integrity, compassion, and hard work, shaping me into the person I am today. His legacy lives on in the lessons he imparted and the love he shared, guiding me through life's journey with his enduring wisdom and grace. More about my father later on<br/> 
        my Mother was considerably younger than my father, hailing from Dover, Kent, where my early years unfolded a period I'll delve into in detail later. While my recollections of her during that time are limited by my tender age, the stories I've heard paint a vivid picture of her remarkable character.
      
        They say she possessed a culinary talent beyond compare a trait I would come to appreciate fully in later years. Yet, her skills in the kitchen were merely a reflection of her boundless love and care as a mother. She dedicated herself wholeheartedly to raising her four sons, navigating the challenges of life with unwavering strength and grace.
        
        Despite the hardships she encountered, my mother remained steadfast in her commitment to our family, selflessly putting our needs above her own. Her love was the bedrock of our household, her presence a constant source of warmth and comfort. She was not only the heart of our family but also the glue that held us together through every trial and triumph.
        
        Her legacy extends far beyond her culinary creations; it lives on in the love she shared and the values she imparted. Through her example, she taught us the true meaning of resilience, compassion, and unwavering devotion. As I continue to recount my story, I look forward to delving deeper into the memories and moments that define her enduring influence on my life.
      
        My memories of Antrobus Street exist only through the stories my mother shared with me over time. It was in 1941, amidst the chaos of World War II, that our family made the decision to leave Antrobus Street and relocate to Waltham Abbey in London. The war was raging on, and England's vulnerability meant that bombings were a nightly occurrence, casting a shadow of fear over our lives.
      
        During this uncertain time, my brothers were evacuated to Wales for safety. As for me, I was deemed too young to leave my mother's side, and so I remained in London throughout the duration of the war, not seeing my brothers until its end in 1945.
        
        The separation from my brothers and the constant threat of bombings were challenging experiences that defined my early years. Yet, amidst the turmoil, there was a sense of resilience and determination to endure. My family's story, like so many others during that time, is a testament to the strength and courage of ordinary people facing extraordinary circumstances.
        
        Reflecting on these memories, I'm reminded of the sacrifices made by my family and countless others during World War II. It's a chapter of my life that shaped who I am today, instilling in me values of resilience, unity, and gratitude for the peace we now enjoy.
        As I continue to write my story, I honor the past and embrace the journey that has led me to where I am today.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">The forest of Epping, nestled in Waltham Abbey, is not only a sanctuary for diverse wildlife, such as deer, foxes, and birds, but also a haven for history enthusiasts, boasting ancient relics like the ruins of Waltham Abbey, dating back to the 12th century. Despite its tranquil allure, the forest bore witness to the tumultuous years of war, with numerous military bases dotting its landscape. Amidst the serene ambiance, the sight of army trucks and soldiers underscored the gravity of the era. Additionally, the presence of a dedicated army of land girls, young women aiding in agricultural and horticultural endeavors, added to the tapestry of wartime life. As a mere infant at the time, my memories of Waltham Abbey during these years are fleeting, with only a vague recollection of an accident lingering in my mind..<br/><br/>
        By all accounts, the incident unfolded swiftly as I found myself lifted by the gentle hands of a couple of these land girls, undoubtedly charmed by the innocence of a young child. Placed atop one of their bicycles, I must have presented an irresistible sight, prompting their spontaneous act of kindness.
        
        As we strolled along the footpath, the tranquility of the forest was momentarily disrupted by the rumble of an approaching army convoy. Caught up in the moment, the young ladies, exuding a sense of glamour amidst the natural splendor, exchanged smiles and waves with the passing soldiers. Little did they know, nor perhaps did the soldier at the wheel realize, that protruding from the back of one of the trucks was an iron girder, concealed from view.
        
        As the convoy straightened its course, the inevitable collision occurred the end of the girder meeting my unsuspecting head. The ensuing chaos unfolded in a whirlwind of confusion and concern, leaving an indelible mark on all involved
        To this day, a faint scar on my scalp serves as a tangible reminder of life's fragility and the capricious hand of fate. Despite the gravity of the incident, the details remain shrouded in the haze of memory. Legal action was pursued on my behalf by my father, resulting in a compensation award. However, the funds were held in trust until my twenty-first birthday, marking the beginning of another tale yet to unfold.
        The next event in my life moving down to Dover in 1947.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">I found this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dover+kent+uk+in+1947s&client=opera&hs=3xW&sca_esv=9eefd60157f6d7e5&biw=875&bih=429&sxsrf=ACQVn08Za-FcN_ZQ1RbyGoQOPsLMaw2QwQ%3A1712972939964&ei=i-QZZvu9Ot7F4-EP0OylsAo&ved=0ahUKEwi7r-K8ib6FAxXe4jgGHVB2CaYQ4dUDCBA&oq=dover+kent+uk+in+1947s&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFmRvdmVyIGtlbnQgdWsgaW4gMTk0N3NIAFAAWABwAHgBkAEAmAEAoAEAqgEAuAEMyAEAmAIAoAIAmAMAkgcAoAcA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:b73656ea,vid:jP0QRTP554s,st:">movie</a> it will give you a good idea what Dover was like just after the war.<br><br>Mum and Dad were entrepreneurs; they were the first to obtain a hotelier's license in Dover after the war. With this, they opened "Claire House" and operated a guesthouse at 138 Folkestone, Dover. This establishment marked the beginning of my childhood memories, preceding our departure from Epping. The reunion with our sons and brothers filled us with joy, as the war had ended, although rationing still persisted for most foods.

          I believe Mum and Dad ventured into the hospitality industry due to the availability of extra rationing coupons, providing them with resources to sustain their business. Naturally, this aspect of our family's affairs was kept discreet, not to be discussed outside our family circle.<br><br>With the extra rationing coupons acquired for the hotel business, Dad managed to obtain fuel for a vehicle a Vauxhall, from what I remember. It resembled an ex-army vehicle, likely one that served military personnel during the war. Its spacious interior accommodated all of us boys, along with Mum, with Dad at the wheel. We embarked on day trips, exploring the countryside and visiting quaint villages. Occasionally, Dad would pull over at a cozy pub, where we enjoyed refreshing lemonades while Mum and Dad indulged in their favorite drinks.<br/>
          
          One memorable occasion stands out when we visited Dad's relatives in Eastbourne. It marked my introduction to Jewish cuisine at the tender age of seven. The table was adorned with delicacies like smoked salmon, rollmops, matzos, anchovies, and potato salad. This culinary experience sparked my lifelong love for fine foods, igniting a passion at a young age.<br>   With the reopening of the channel, Dover bustled with activity as people flocked to use the cross-channel ferries. This surge in visitors kept Mum and Dad busy at the guesthouse. After about a year, ever the one to seek improvement, Dad decided to relocate us to a larger residence, providing more rooms for guests. Thus, we packed our belongings and moved across the road to 167 Folkestone Road.
          
          It was during this time that I grew particularly close to <a href="images/mydad.jpg">my father</a>. I often accompanied him on his shopping trips, eagerly climbing into our beloved Vauxhall. I felt a sense of pride every time I stepped into the car, especially considering that owning a car alone was enough to turn heads at that time. Dad also acquired a little dog, Rex, a crossbreed of unknown origin. Whenever Rex was in the back of the car, he was fiercely protective, barking at anyone who dared approach the vehicle. Dad found solace in knowing Rex was there, ensuring our safety.<br><br>On our shopping trips back then, supermarkets where you could buy all you need in one place didn't exist. Instead, we frequented local shops a butcher, grocer, fruiterer, and even farms for fresh chicken. I mean really fresh Dad would choose one, and the farmer would promptly prepare it while it was still running around, ending its life in front of us. But let's get back to the shopping.
          
          Dad would stride into these stores with me following in awe. "Hi, Morrie!" Each manager would emerge from their office to greet him, extending their hand for a handshake. This ritual occurred every visit, and there I was, a little me, following in his footsteps. It was the best feeling for me I was bursting with pride for my father. Though at that age, I didn't fully grasp what pride meant, I was in awe and loved him immensely.With each time returning to our vehicle, the car boot was full of different kinds of food <br><br>In all my childhood memories, this period stands out as the best for me. The parties Mum and Dad threw for their friends and business colleagues were simply brilliant. From a young age, I observed a diverse array of people from various occupations attending these gatherings. While my brothers and I were included to a certain extent, as the parties progressed into the evening, we were gently dismissed to our bedtime!
          
          Despite being relegated to our rooms, the energy and excitement of the parties lingered in the air, leaving an indelible impression on my young mind. From the laughter and music to the tantalizing aroma of food, these were a testament to our parents' hospitality and social prowess. Though we may have been tucked away in bed, the memories of those lively gatherings remain etched in my heart.<br/>
          Another memory I have of my father involves him in the kitchen, always cooking something up for us boys. Whenever the front doorbell rang, he would hurriedly make his way to answer it, donning his oversized white apron. With a quick flick, he would fold back one corner of the apron as if it weren't there at all. Upon greeting whoever stood at the door, he would immediately tune into their accent or language, effortlessly imitating them. This knack for mimicry endeared him to everyone he met, fostering instant rapport and camaraderie. He had a remarkable ability to connect with people from all walks of life, a talent that earned him admiration and respect. In my eyes, he could sell ice to the Eskimos.<br>My schooling journey began with attendance at three primary schools. The first was Belgrave Primary, situated right opposite the first Claire House atop a steep hill. My memories of it are fleeting, but I distinctly recall its location across a busy road.
          
          Next was St. Marys Primary in Stembrock, a district in the downtown area. Although I can't recall the duration of my stay, both schools were housed in ancient buildings.
          
          The third, St. Martins Primary in Elms Vale, remains vivid in my memory. I found enjoyment there, as it boasted modern facilities compared to the previous two. However, I encountered a challenging experience with an English teacher. During a test, sunlight streaming into the room made the blackboard unreadable. When I leaned forward to get a better view, the teacher accused me of cheating. Despite my protests, the situation escalated, leading to my departure from the school. Fortunately, my father believed my account of the incident.
          
          Meanwhile, my brothers Michael and Lionel were old enough to apply to join the Royal Navy HMS Mercury training school. As for David, he must have been attending a school in Dover.
          
          Subsequently, David and I were enrolled in Horam boarding school for boys near Hailsham, Sussex. The school boasted excellent teachers and picturesque grounds. The Principal, a passionate butterfly collector, nurtured my interest in entomology. Despite the pleasant environment, I struggled with the mandatory Sunday tea of macaroni cheese and goat's milk, leading to clandestine food exchanges among dormitory mates.
          
          However, my time at the boarding school was short-lived due to a severe case of ringworm. Placed in quarantine, I stayed with an Uncle and Auntie nearby for three months, undergoing treatment at Middlesex Hospital. Despite efforts to cure the ringworm, it persisted, resulting in the nurses manually removing each affected hair a process I endured longer than any other patient.
          
          During my absence, my nephew Peter was with us at the at the boarding school, he was briefly sent to stay with me at our relatives, but his parents promptly retrieved him. Consequently, I found myself residing with unfamiliar relatives who imposed strict rules, possibly due to my infectious condition.
          
          Looking back, my schooling years so far were a mixed bag of challenges and memorable experiences, shaping me in unexpected ways.<br/> December 1950, a new addition to the family arrived: my little brother, Phillip. With his arrival, the Magner family grew to include five boys. Additionally, I took on the responsibility of caring for Phillip during his early years, a role I can elaborate on later.<br></p>

        <h3 class="subtitle-section">Growing Up in Dover Dover in the 1950s remained scarred by the ravages of war, with bomb sites and debris still littering the landscape long after the conflict had ceased...</h3>
        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">After being given the all-clear from the hospital, signifying that I was no longer infectious due to the successful eradication of the ringworm, I returned home to Claire House. I still had to wear something on my head as I was bald from having all my hair removed to treat the ringworm, although it was starting to show some growth as each day passed, with stubble beginning to appear.

          Resuming my education meant that returning to the boarding school was no longer an option. David was no longer there, much to his delight at being back home. However, after a week or so, I found myself being taken to another school, The Manor House Day School in Hythe.<br/>The school was situated in a literally Manor House, a grand mansion set amidst wonderful grounds, surrounded by an amazing array of different plants, bushes, and trees. There was even a very old-looking Mulberry tree that was fruiting at the time of my visit.
          
          The uniform we had to wear was a bright red, almost scarlet, peaked cap, along with a single-breasted blazer and gray flannel trousers. I loved it! There was just one slight problem with attending this wonderful school it was about 25 miles from Claire House, and there was nobody available to take me there or bring me back home. However, my father, on the way home from our visit to the school, drove me to the Folkestone bus station and showed me how we could overcome this problem.
          
          On school days, I would don my bright hat and blazer and board a bus that stopped right outside Claire House, heading to the Folkestone bus station. From there, I would catch another bus to Hythe and the school. With the buses running on time, the journey took just under an hour. And so, I embarked on another phase of my school life. Surprisingly, despite my baldness, I was not harassed by the other boys. In fact, they were quite friendly, and I made good friends with one of them.
          
          Attending the lessons was not a chore; quite the opposite. We covered all the usual subjects and even delved into a couple of languages. I learned a lot during my time at this school. I didn't mind the traveling, especially as wearing the colorful uniform often sparked conversations with other passengers on the bus. I suppose I'm a bit of a showman at heart! <br/>
          
          Life during that time held its own blend of joys and sorrows. While weekdays were spent immersed in a school that captured my heart, weekends offered solace among the few friends I had made at 167 Folkestone Road. <br/>However, the shadow of poverty loomed over the streets surrounding Claire House, particularly Clarendon Street and Clarendon Place, where terraced houses lined the roads, punctuated only by corner shops and the occasional chippie.<br/>
          My friendships, forged during my time at Belgrave Primary School, provided a sense of connection, even if you didn't always engage in regular play together. Yet, amidst these fleeting moments of camaraderie, a devastating blow struck. Returning home one day during a game of football, I was met by a neighbour who delivered the heart-wrenching news: my father had passed away from a massive heart attack. It was a moment that shattered my world, leaving me with grief and uncertainty. Losing the person I loved most at such a tender age was an unimaginable pain to bear, marking September 1951 as a turning point in my young life. I was told later, that baby Phillip was on my Fathers knee when this awful event took place.<br/>Several days following the tragic event, the family gathered in the downstairs lounge to discuss the arrangements for our father's funeral. Among those present, I recall my brother Michael, who had returned home after being invalided out of the navy, adding another blow to our already grieving family. Lionel, dressed in his naval uniform, was there too, alongside David, who was undergoing training at a hotel in Folkestone, a placement arranged by our father. Another notable presence was my step-sister Zena, the mother of Peter, who had been with us at the Horsham boarding school. And, of course, our brave and courageous mother.<br/>
          
          However, what followed during that discussion has remained etched in my memory, haunting me with unanswered questions to this day. I cannot recall the exact words or actions that triggered it, but Zena became upset with something that I said or did. Without anyone coming to my defense or explaining the situation, she made the painful declaration that I should not attend our father's funeral. The absence of clarity surrounding my exclusion from the funeral has left me grappling with unresolved feelings and a lingering sense of incompleteness regarding my father's passing.<br/><br/>
          Life without Dad brought significant challenges, especially for our mother, who not only managed the hotel but also bore the weight of its financial burdens.
          
          In the subsequent year, I lost my placement at Manor House School due to the overwhelming cost of tuition. By February 1952, at the age of twelve, I was enrolled in Astor Avenue Secondary Modern School. Over the next three years, life settled into a routine as we navigated the best we could. Michael stepped in to assist Mum with the day-to-day operations of the business, while she received support from Biddy, a kind-hearted lady, and Irene, a young helper.
          
          Attending school became a mechanical task for me; though physically present, my mind wandered elsewhere, struggling to find focus. Every lunchtime, I walked home to Claire House, where Mum or Biddy would ensure I had a meal. After eating, I bid farewell and retraced my steps back to school a routine I repeated for the duration of my time there. While classmates formed bonds and engaged in games, I remained somewhat isolated, lacking close friends.<br/>
          
          On weekends, I took on the responsibility of looking after Phillip, often taking him out in his pram for outings. One memorable day, we visited Penchester Park, where a small river flowed toward the seafront. As we sat by the bank enjoying sandwiches prepared by Biddy, a startling sight caught my eye a white bundle floating downstream. Reacting swiftly, I secured the pram and rushed into the water, rescuing a baby as it drew near. We scanned the area upstream, where we spotted an overturned pram; the baby, unstrapped, had tumbled into the river. Moments later, a distressed woman arrived, frantically searching for her child. Seeing the woman I gladly returned the baby to her, who was overcome with relief and gratitude and asked for my name. Then we had to return home, I was soaking wet, will I be believed when I tell what had happened? <br/><br/>
          Another significant event for the family was Michael marrying Irene, a natural progression given their close working relationship. Irene was a lovely young woman, while Michael was both intelligent and handsome, having earned accolades for his academic achievements, including passing exams with merits. Despite being on a path that could have led him to university, he chose to join the Royal Navy.<br/>
          
          I remember a particular moment when we were both in the lower lounge, Michael studying for a customs exam while we listened to classical music. Suddenly, Michael began shaking uncontrollably, experiencing convulsions. I rushed to his side, feeling utterly helpless.
          
          Thankfully, Mum heard my panicked shouts and rushed to our aid. She guided Michael to the floor, directing me to fetch a spoon from the cutlery drawer. Placing the spoon in his mouth, she prevented him from biting his tongue until the episode passed, and Michael could rest.<br/>
          
          Confused and concerned, I asked Mum what had happened. It was then that she revealed the reason for Michael's departure from the Navy: he was epileptic. He had experienced similar episodes in his youth, and while doctors had suggested he might outgrow them, the incident on board his ship proved otherwise.<br/>
          Lionel continued to thrive in his naval career, achieving the rank of petty officer, though the specifics of his duties remained a mystery to us. The last time we saw him was at Michael's wedding, where he mentioned his upcoming assignment on the aircraft carrier HMS Centaur. There's one remarkable moment I must mention about Lionel: he was selected as one of the sailors to pull the gun carriage carrying King George during his funeral parade in London.<br/>
          
          Meanwhile, David decided to leave his position at the Burlington Hotel in Folkestone as the summer season approached in Dover, signaling the start of the cross-channel ferry operations. He joined one of these ships, effectively becoming a part of the Merchant Navy.<br/> When you work on these vessels, you sign articles for the duration of the voyage and receive a discharge book, akin to a passport, with your photo and relevant details. Upon completing your term, the book is stamped again, indicating your rating. In David's case, his rating was Asst Stwd (Assistant Steward). This book could serve as a portfolio for future employment opportunities with other companies.<br/>
          
          With Micheal married Lionel and David occupied with their careers, I found myself as the only one left who could offer assistance to my mother. Of course, Phillip was there, but he was still too young to fully understand the situation.<br/><br/>One day, I encountered a lady who lived a few doors away from Claire House, Mrs. Cotton. I believed she was an acquaintance of my mother. As I was entering my teens, I found her quite attractive for her age, being a widow. Mrs. Cotton mentioned to me that she owned a Fruit & Vegetable shop on Dover's Tower Street and was in need of someone to handle deliveries on Saturday mornings and occasionally on Wednesday afternoons. Without hesitation, I eagerly accepted the offer, thrilled at the prospect of my first part-time job that would provide me with my own pocket money to spend however I pleased.<br/>

          Dover boasted four cinemas in total. The Odeon, situated atop the town, was the most prestigious, albeit not easily accessible. Despite the challenge, it was considered the best in Dover, with an organ that played enchanting music before each film screening. Decked out in ornate dÃƒÂ©cor from the 1930s, a visit to the Odeon promised an enjoyable experience with a unique ambience.<br/>
          
          The Gaumont cinema, located in midtown, was a more modern establishment, offering comfortable seating and continuous movie screenings throughout the week. This was the cinema I frequented most often, as it was conveniently situated for me. I recall one memorable evening when I took my heavily pregnant mother, a fan of one of the film stars, to a screening. As we exited the auditorium, I had to intervene when she inadvertently linked arms with a bewildered stranger, jokingly I said to her "come on Mum you have enough men in her life already, let that poor man go ".<br/>
          
          Another cinema I frequented was the Plaza, a little further down from the Gaumont. Although it was nicknamed 'The Flea Pit' due to its affordability, I always enjoyed my time there. One film that left a lasting impression on me was 'Carmen' starring Dorothy Dandridge; I was so captivated by the music and singing that I watched it three times.
          
          Lastly, there was the ABC Grenada, just off the market square. As a child, I was allowed to attend the Saturday morning screenings, which were tailored for young children like myself. This early introduction to cinema became a regular part of my routine, especially in my early teens, now that I had a part-time job."<br/>I must have watched nearly every movie featuring Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, George Raft, Lon Chaney, Peter Lorre, Clarke Gable, John Wayne, and the list goes on. Each film left its mark on me, not necessarily for the violence, which by today's standards was relatively mild, but for the compelling stories they told.<br/>

          In my late teens, I witnessed the birth of rock & roll music, which became widely available. I fondly recall attending Saturday night dances at the town hall and the Co-op hall, where I had the privilege of seeing live performances by Lonnie Donegan and Bill Haley and His Comets.
          
          Then came the emergence of coffee shops with jukeboxes. I vividly remember one evening, dressed in my best attire, I strolled down to the market square where a new coffee shop had opened its doors. As I approached, the vibrant sounds of rock & roll spilled onto the street, drawing me in. However, in my eagerness, I failed to notice the clear glass front door and embarrassingly walked right into it, becoming the unintentional entertainment for those inside. Despite the embarrassment, I quickly gathered myself and turned away, never returning to that coffee shop again.<br/>In those years, there were gangs of youths known as Teddy Boys, clad in long jackets and drainpipe trousers, with thick crepe-soled shoes often referred to as 'beetle crushers.' Most of these boys sported a hairstyle slicked back into what they called a 'Ducks Arse.' Whenever I caught sight of them, I swiftly retreated to avoid their notice.

          Another group that emerged during that era were the Mods, distinguished by their clean-cut appearance, tight-fitting suits, and pointed shoes known as 'winkle pickers.' Their preferred mode of transportation was the Vespa scooter.
          
          I always steered clear of these subcultures, preferring to remain a loner rather than aligning myself with any particular group.<br></p>

        <h3 class="subtitle-section"><strong>Claire House</strong>-Life's twists and turns often unfold swiftly, leaving us with little control over the course of events .</h3>
        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">After <a href="images/wedding.jpg">Micheal & Irene</a> were married, they stayed on at Claire House for a few more months until they found somewhere to live, and then they moved out. Biddy continued to be a great help to my mother, providing much-needed support during a challenging time.<br/> Then, one day, a new person arrived at Claire House. He was introduced to me as Eddie, the brother of one of my uncles, although I wasn't aware of our family connection at the time. Little did I know that he was soon going to become my stepfather, bringing significant changes to our lives.

          At that time, I lacked the business acumen and knowledge required to run a business, and I could sense that my mother must have been feeling overwhelmed, both emotionally and financially, since the loss of Dad.<br/> Eddie's arrival seemed to offer a glimmer of hope and stability, and before long, he and my mother were married.
          
          As for us boys, Phillip and I were too young to fully comprehend the implications of the marriage. Meanwhile, Micheal, Lionel, and David were preoccupied with their own lives and responsibilities.<br/>
          
          In the initial months following Eddie's arrival, things felt somewhat awkward. I wasn't sure what to say or how to interact, so I stuck to my usual routine. Each morning, around 7 o'clock, I'd make a trip to the local bakery, conveniently located just across the road in an area known as Winchelsea Rd. The bakery, nestled into the side of a hill, was a fascinating sight for a young boy like me. Stepping inside, I'd be greeted by the aroma of freshly baked bread and the sight of large mixers and ovens. Eagerly, I'd collect our order and hurry back home to Claire House, enjoying the taste of a fresh crusty roll along the way.<br/>
          
          This routine repeated itself three days a week, depending on how busy Claire House was. Upon my return, Eddie would often be up and about, preparing tea for Mum and himself. We'd exchange greetings, and then I'd settle down to have some breakfast before heading off to school. The routine became familiar, and we all adjusted to our new dynamic.<br>
          However, our lives were soon to undergo another significant change with the news of Mum's pregnancy. Over the next three years, she brought four more children into the world: Tony, Carol, and twins Steven and Paul. While this undoubtedly brought joy and fulfillment to Eddie, for me, Phillip, and perhaps even Mum, it introduced a new set of challenges and adjustments. The dynamics of our family shifted once again, as we navigated the complexities of welcoming new siblings and adjusting to our evolving family structure<br/>In time as Tony grew he joined Phillip and myself on our outings where would go for an outing the beach and spend a couple hours there. Tony would be in the push chair and I would Phillip walking beside some time I let him stand on the side of the push so he could ride giving him a rest times.<br/> This particular day we were watching men working on some sea defenses it was all fenced off with wire fencing and we stood there on the outside of the fence and watched them going about there work. At the site there was a crane well inside of the fenced site it was what it looked to me anyway the crane started up and was manoeuvring into position when the iron hook on the end of the line swung round over the wire fence onto our side and whacked Phillip on the side of his head, it happened all to quickly to do anything to get out of the way.<br/> The workmen stood in horror seeing just what had happened some of them rushed around to give some assistance. The side of Phillips head became a terrible sight enlarged and blue looking. The foreman I presumed he was the foreman got hold of Phillip and rushed him to the hospital. leaving me and Tony in a state of distress.<br/>  However one of the workmen got us into vehicle and drove us to the hospital where Phillip was it was good that the foreman got Phillip to the hospital quickly where placed ice packs on to bring swelling down they X rayed him, all was good no damage.<br/> To this day I still have dreams about it, how Phillip looked with a big blue swelling on the side of his face. Of course I was interrogated by Mum as to how this could of happened. It was a few weeks before we could all get over it. Which Phillip did with no after effects.<br/>
          As Tony grew older, it became increasingly evident that he faced challenges with normal childhood tasks. It became apparent that he would require special needs support as he continued to grow. Meanwhile, Carol blossomed into a lovely little girl, eager to assist our mother and Tony to the best of her abilities. However, managing the twins proved to be quite a handful.<br />
          
          Occasionally, guests would stay at Claire House, requiring full board accommodation with breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided. Our mother, as always, was the mainstay in the kitchen. When Dad was alive, meal preparation was a collaborative effort between them, often turning into a friendly competition to see who could create the tastiest dish. Of course, Mum emerged victorious every time, but it added a fun element to the tasks.<br/><br/>
          
          However, after Dad's passing, it became evident that Eddie lacked culinary skills. Even serving the meals proved to be a challenge for him, as he had spent most of his life as a seaman and had little experience in the kitchen. <br/> With Mum's pregnancy, there were times when she couldn't be in the kitchen at all. Recognizing this, Mum began teaching me some simple recipes that I could prepare during her absences to help manage the cooking duties. I did have Biddy around at times to assist me<br/>
          Returning to the present, it was clear that Eddie lacked culinary skills. Despite his years spent at sea as a seaman, cooking and serving meals were foreign tasks to him. Nonetheless, he had to adapt and do his best to contribute to the household.<br/>
          
          Unbeknown to me, this experience laid the foundation for a future career in hospitality. Academic pursuits held little appeal for me, especially as I witnessed the challenges at home. <br/>It seemed that Eddie was grappling with alcoholism, likely exacerbated by the pressures of managing Claire House. Despite this, he still had responsibilities beyond the business, with four children needing his attention.<br>
          
          Eddie often requested that I fetch him a bottle of gin from the pub or off-license, a task I used to fulfill without question. However, as his drinking habits became more apparent, I began to avoid his requests, preferring not to be around when he asked.<br/><br/>
          
          When my brothers learned about what was happening, they banded together to support our mother and attempted to remove Eddie from the picture. However, Mum adamantly refused to entertain the idea. As for me, I was in no position to take any action, so the matter was eventually set aside, and we continued with our lives.<br/><br/>
          
          The children were growing rapidly, with Carol increasingly assisting Mum. Tony received aid for his disabilities, while the twins continued to be a handful, lacking the firm guidance they needed from their father. Though I earned some respect from them, I didn't interact with them much. Phillip, on the other hand, spent most days with them.<br/><br/>
          
          In my final year at school, I still had to leave when Religious Education was taught, and instead this year, I attended music lessons. The previous year, it was art with Mr. Beaumont, a nice guy, but I struggled with art. The year before that was woodwork with Mr. Hayward, an elderly gentleman, but that was even more challenging for me. So, music it was for my last year, taught by Mr. Dickinson.<br/> It was in this class that I met my best mate & only friend I had made at this school, Sid King. I can't recall why he was in this class, but we bonded instantly, despite coming from different backgrounds - me from Folkestone Road and Sid from Clarendon Road.<br/><br/>
          
          Throughout the year, we were inseparable. After school, we'd often head to the cinema or occasionally take the bus to the Folkestone swimming pool. At some point, we both enrolled in The Big Brother Scheme to immigrate to Australia. Surprisingly, our parents gave us permission, perhaps eager to see us venture out on our own. We even went as far as having chest X-rays, and we both passed. However, after going through all the paperwork and preparations, Sid decided he didn't want to go through with it, and I certainly wasn't going to go alone.<br/>
          
          Despite that, Sid and I remained great friends until we eventually lost contact when we both left to start our working lives.<br/>
          As my birthday fell in February, I could leave school at the Easter break, which I did. In Dover during that period, the primary employment options were either working on the cross-channel ferries when they resumed for the summer season or in the coalmines, of which there were three not too far from Dover. However, working in the mines was definitely not something I had in mind.
          
          Instead, I decided to apply for a job on the cross-channel ferries, which started operating again at Easter. I was hired<br></p>

        <h3 class="subtitle-section">The beginning of my working life marked a significant transition, filled with uncertainty about what lay ahead and where this journey would ultimately take me.</h3>
        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">When the time came for us to part ways, realizing that neither Sid nor I would be going to Australia, I found myself at a loss regarding what to do next. Syd faced a similar uncertainty; his father worked in the mines, but Syd was adamant about not following in his footsteps. I can't recall if Syd left school at the same time as me. And so, without any formal send-off, I bid farewell to school. However, the options available to me in the 1950s were incredibly limited. I wasn't academically inclined, so pursuing further education wasn't a viable path. Moreover, employment opportunities in Dover, only five years after the war, were practically nonexistent.<br/>

          The only immediate option seemed to be the cross-channel ferries, which were gearing up for their summer season. However, this line of work meant being stuck in a cycle of seasonal employment, working only six months out of the year. The alternative was staying put at Claire House, but with Eddie's behavior worsening, particularly due to the twins' antics, that wasn't a feasible option. Therefore, the logical choice was to embark on a season with the ferries, gaining some work experience and, hopefully, saving up some money. Then, after the six-month stint, I could start exploring opportunities beyond Dover.With that plan in mind I would still be in a position to help and assist Mum where I can also keep an eye out for Phillip, Tony and Carol<br/><br/>Nearly all of the shipping, including ferries, docks at two locations in Dover Harbour: the Eastern Arm Docks and the Western Arm Docks. At the Eastern Arm, the ships primarily carry vehicles and passengers, while the Western Arm Docks cater mainly to walk-on passengers and other vessels that transport trains across the channel. One such train is the famous the Golden Arrow, which departs from London Victoria, boards the ferry, and continues its journey to Paris, France.
          
          The Western Docks operate year-round, whereas the Eastern Arm Docks were seasonal until the early 1960s when they began operating year-round.<br/>So on the 30th of March 1955, I went through the formalities of registering as a seaman. (Well, as a Pantry Boy, you have to start somewhere.) In fact, I had joined the Merchant Navy. At the time, it didn't occur to me that I would essentially be part of the Navy, albeit not the Royal Navy. Regardless, I was now a part of an organization at just fifteen years old. The experience was a mix of excitement and fear. In the registration office, I was surrounded by seasoned sailors signing up for the same ship, making me feel like nothing more than a boy amidst men <br/> With the 1955 season starting , and I have signed articles as a Pantry Boy I can now join as part of the crew on a vessel named <a href="images/halladale.jpeg">TSS Halladale</a> , a converted naval frigate. This vessel was designed to accommodate and transport passengers and their vehicles across the English Channel, featuring a roll-on, roll-off conversation system.<br/>As dawn broke, we gathered at the <a href="images/ramps.jpg">Eastern Docks</a>, awaiting the arrival of the ship freshly refitted for the summer season. With precision, it backed in, aligning the stern for the ramp's descent, welcoming us aboard.<br/>
          
          A diverse mix of personnel streamed onto the ship. Some wore uniforms, likely officers, while others, sporting sailors' hats and sturdy jeans, assumed the roles of deckhands. Then there were those, like myself, dressed casually, presumably part of the catering team.<br/>
          
          Navigating the ship seemed daunting for those of us in civilian attire until a friendly face introduced himself as the Second Steward, guiding us to the restaurant area. Following his lead, we embarked on a quick tour of the decks, familiarizing ourselves with our workspaces.
          
          Amidst the group, I noticed I was likely the youngest, surrounded by seasoned men engaged in conversation and introductions.<br/>
          
          Once settled, assignments were distributed, along with the areas each of us was tasked with keeping spotless. Quickly, I learned the term "scrubout" - my domain being the toilets. Alongside me was Les Aston, who swiftly became a trusted friend, imparting invaluable lessons on seafaring work ethics.<br/>
          
          As a recent school leaver, stepping into my role as a Pantry boy aboard the ship marked the beginning of a journey into the world of maritime service. In those initial days, our focus was on preparing the vessel for the upcoming summer season of sailings, despite its recent refit.<br/>
          
          The interior of the ship demanded our attention, requiring thorough cleaning and the meticulous arrangement of furniture to ensure the comfort of our passengers. On the main deck, a bustling array of amenities awaited, from the inviting allure of the Bar and the allure of the Duty-Free shop to the culinary delights of the Buffet and Restaurant. Below deck lay the essential facilities of bathrooms and toilets, vital for the convenience of all on board.
          
          However, our duties extended beyond mere cleanliness. As the ship prepared for its voyages, stocking up on provisions was paramount. The Duty-Free shop, in particular, demanded careful attention, with its array of bonded goods requiring meticulous handling. I vividly recall the formalities surrounding the arrival of cigarettes, spirits, and liquor, each carton subject to scrutiny by a customs agent before being secured below deck.<br/>
          
          The process of stocking up was a well-choreographed routine, with the crew forming a line to transport the goods from the delivery point to their designated storage area. Each crew member played a vital role, passing the cargo along until it reached its final destination. This ritual would be repeated countless times throughout the summer season, a testament to the meticulous preparation required for each voyage.
          
          Amidst the hustle and bustle of provisioning, there were moments of quiet reflection as well. As passengers embarked and disembarked, I found myself returning repeatedly to my designated "scrubout" areas, under the watchful eye of seasoned crew members. It was a period of intense learning, with each repetition honing my skills until my work met the exacting standards of cleanliness expected at sea.<br/>
          
          During the crossings, my days were predominantly spent in the pantry, where the steady rhythm of washing up became second nature. It was a role that demanded diligence and attention to detail, qualities I endeavored to cultivate as I embraced my responsibilities on board.
          
          In retrospect, those early days were filled with challenges and opportunities for growth, laying the foundation for the adventures that lay ahead on the open sea.<br/>
          Continuing on, I spent two more summer seasons on board, being laid off each winter. During those winters, I found employment in various hotels. It wasn't until 1956, when I came of age to drive, that I managed to acquire an old second-hand car. Around that time, the conflict known as the Seven-Day War erupted between Egypt and Israel. Despite the turmoil, I pursued diving lessons and obtained a provisional driving license. Interestingly, due to the war, I was granted the privilege to drive without supervision. This newfound freedom allowed me to seek live-in jobs outside of Dover until the next summer season, a routine I maintained for the following three years.<br/>
          
          In May 1957, however, I seized a different opportunity. Hearing that another ship was desperately short of Assistant Stewards, I decided to apply, aiming to elevate my rating from Pantry boy. Despite being just 17, a year shy of the official requirement for the role, the shortage of crew members worked in my favor. They signed me up and stamped my discharge book, granting me an adult rate of pay. After a couple of months in this new role, I returned to Dover with my upgraded rating. There, I joined the SS Dinnard as an Assistant Steward, remaining with the ship until November 1957. Subsequently, I returned to the Halladale, where I stayed until late 1958.<br/>During one of my winter layoffs, I found myself seeking employment in hotels through a specialized catering employment agency. On my first assignment with the agency, they sent me to the Casino Hotel on Taggs Island, Hampton Court, London, where they were in need of a commie-barman.<br/>
          
          Armed with my car and the ability to drive, I packed my meager belongings and embarked on the journey to London, a little over two hours away. Arriving at <a href="images/taggs-island.jpg">Taggs</a> Island, I was struck by its unique setting with a small bridge spanning the Thames led to the island, entirely occupied by the hotel, with houseboats moored all around.
          
          After a brief interview with the resident cocktail barman, during which we discussed my duties and I was outfitted with the hotel's uniform, I was shown to my living quarters a houseboat moored nearby. As I changed into the uniform, the barman returned to his post, and it was already mid-afternoon.<br/>
          
          The cocktail bar itself resembled those seen in movies, with a mirrored backdrop showcasing an array of glassware and spirits from around the world. Although I recognized some, many were unfamiliar, and I knew I had much to learn. The oval-shaped bar was surrounded by stools, awaiting the arrival of patrons.
          
          Feeling somewhat professional, thanks to my experience in a pub, albeit on a smaller scale, I was left to begin my tasks while the barman went for his lunch. With cleaning being my second nature, given my previous experience cleaning ship toilets, I tackled the task in stages, starting with the back mirrors.<br/>
          
          However, my concentration was soon interrupted by the arrival of two customers a young couple with distinctly posh accents. Attempting to remain composed, I greeted them and inquired how I could assist. Their order a pair of brandy Alexanders left me momentarily flustered, but I assured them it was my first day and set about gathering the ingredients.<br/>
          
          Unfortunately, my attempt at shaking the cocktail went awry when I forgot to secure the lid on the shaker, resulting in a messy splatter of brandy, creme de cacao, and cream across the freshly cleaned back mirror. Despite their initial disappointment, the couple found humor in the situation, and we shared a laugh at my expense until the barman returned, his expression a mixture of shock and amusement at the sight before him.<br/>
          
          <a href="Taggs.html">Taggs Island</a>
          Taggs Island indeed marked the beginning of my journey as a commie-barman, a role filled with both challenges and rewards. However, as winter settled in and the chill of the nights grew sharper, the discomfort of sleeping on the houseboat became increasingly unbearable. Despite my appeals for additional bedding being met with denial and an indifferent response to my discomfort, I made the difficult decision to depart, packing my belongings and leaving on Christmas day.
          
          Shortly after, I joined the crew of the SS Dinnard, where I encountered Charlie Byrom, another steward. Charlie took me under his wing, showing kindness and mentorship. He became not just a colleague, but a friend, and I fondly recall the valuable lessons he imparted about the steward's role.
          
          It was a memorable experience aboard the SS Dinnard, and Charlie's invitation to spend Christmas with his family in Sittingbourne added to the warmth of the season. With that invitation in mind, I found the courage to bid farewell to Taggs Island, knowing there was another place where I belonged.<br></p>

        <h2 class="title-section" id="chapter-7">chapter 7<br></h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle-section">The Bull dates back to the 1300's as a coaching inn offering respite to weary travellers along the Pilgrim's Way.

          An infamous haunt of smuggling gangs was the "Bull Inn." In 1799 a gang leader, Lieutenant Colonel Shadwell, was shot dead on 1st June by an army deserter, and his comrades wreaked a terrible revenge. The murderer and his comrade were savagely beaten to death by the smugglers, an event recorded on a stone set into the wall by the hotel.
          
          "With an eclectic past, including being the headquarters of a renowned gang of smugglers, as well as a favourite watering hole for Battle of Britain pilots, the 600 hundred year old Bull is now a beautiful four star country retreat as well as a gourmet dining destination with an AA rosette for culinary excellence.</h3>
        <h4 class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">During my time in 1958, I embarked on a transformative journey within the vibrant hospitality industry. Following my seasonal stint aboard the Halladale, I found myself at a crossroads. Uncertain of my future in Dover and seeking a more enduring career path, I made the bold decision to pursue my passion for hospitality.

        In July of 1958, I took the leap and reached out to an agency, expressing my aspirations for a career in this dynamic field. Soon after, an opportunity emerged at the Bull Hotel, where I was warmly welcomed into the fold. As a waiter, I found myself under the tutelage of the esteemed head waiter, Alan Baines, whose jovial demeanor and wealth of experience enriched my journey. Under his guidance, I honed my skills in the art of service, mastering the intricacies of fine dining and customer care. He was quite a character. He had a way of making you feel at ease, even when the restaurant was bustling with activity. His attention to detail and dedication to his craft inspired me to strive for excellence in my own work. 
        
        At the Bull Hotel, renowned for its culinary prowess, I embraced the intricacies of service, from assisting patrons with flair to learning the art of tableside cooking. The restaurant buzzed with activity, the ceilng in the the public is adorned with the signatures of valiant fighter pilots from World War II, a testament to the hotel's rich history.
        
        Among the eclectic clientele, one figure stood out Colonel Whintel, distinguished by his monocle and refined mannerisms. His presence added a touch of intrigue to our bustling establishment, as tales of his past escapades echoed through the halls.
        
        In the midst of culinary delights and memorable encounters, I found friendship among fellow staff members from the diligentcouple barmen to the dedicated housekeepers. The proprietors, Mr. and Mrs. Dixon, presided over the bustling establishment, their vision and dedication shaping the hotel's legacy.
        
        As I immersed myself in the vibrant tapestry of hospitality at the Bull Hotel, I discovered not only a career path but also a sense of belonging within a community driven by passion and friendship.
        Other employees were a couple of barmen one for the public and one for cocktail bar, couple of house keepers, and of course the kitchen staff. The owners were always about Mr Mrs Dixon and then were was another Mrs Dixon could not really find out where she fitted in the. One the housekeepers told she was the former wife of Mr Dixon!!!!
      
        After being there for a couple months they started to renovations to the hotel making the restaurant bigger and creating a lovely timber bar area. With the new extensions couple of new employees joined us. One of them was a young Irish girl to join me and Alan in the restaurant. we all worked well together the three of us were a good team in the restaurant. Till after one really busy weekend we get up for the breakfast shift on the Sunday morning only to be told that Alan had gone and taking all the monies + & from the gratuities.<br/> Sheila and I were getting on well with each other and spent our break times and eventually going out on our days off together. Sheila owned a Lambretta and we used this to get around the countryside. When would rode out me as a passenger on the back. But it did not take long before Sheila relinquished the driving and asked me to take over, we also spent many hours walking in the countryside. We had lots of outings and when the weather was not good we listened to radio Luxembourg which was the best radio station at that time.<br/> While Sheila was older than me, we found ourselves engaging in conversations on various topics, discovering a compatibility in our opinions. One topic of discussion was my desire to move to Australia or New Zealand, which we both agreed would be an exciting opportunity. Throughout our conversations, it became evident to me that Sheila was a devout Catholic. This fact didn't concern me much, and I simply mentioned to Sheila that I was uncertain about my own beliefs, leaving the matter at that. I knew that eventually, we would need to have a more in-depth discussion about our differing beliefs.<br/>
        Sheila lived in the hotel had lovely room which it was one of the guests room, my room was above the old stables the other guys were on the same floor. 
        There was young cocktail barman in his twenties in the next room we got on well he was older than me and with it more experience of our work and of life. I suppose I was taken in by him and hung on his every word. He was talking of going to Spain to get some working experience at the time I said I would love to go with him. We made plans to do this.<br/> Before I moved to the Bull hotel I had a suit made for me it was in the Italian style of the time, pale blue, I was very proud of it and felt grand when I was wearing. This barman I cannot remember his name, saw the suit hanging in my wardrobe then asked if he could try it on we were of the same build being naive I let him take it away to his room it was in the evening after service, thinking he will bring it back in the morning. You guessed it the next morning he was gone suit and all just walked out and left. Leaving me devastated losing my pride and joy and with a lesson learnt <br/>As time passed, Alan was replaced by a young Italian head waiter named Joseph, who spoke English with an Italian accent and carried himself with confidence. With the completion of renovations in the cocktail bar and restaurant, we settled into a routine of providing meal service, though the trend of cooking at the table had diminished. During this period, the music and songs from the film/show My Fair Lady were immensely popular and played every night during food service.
        
        On our shared days off, Sheila and I arranged our schedules so we could spend three consecutive days together. This allowed us to visit our respective families; I would travel to Dover to see my mother, while Sheila would visit her father. We coordinated these trips with the consent of the management.
        
        During one of my visits home, upon returning to the Bull Hotel, I was informed by a housekeeper, who was aware of the close bond between Sheila and me, that something had happened to Sheila in my absence. She had informed Mr. Dixon of her decision to leave and was currently in her room, packing.
        
        Rushing to find her, I discovered Sheila in the lobby, awaiting her father to escort her home. It became clear to me that Joseph had taken advantage of her during my absence. On a couple of quiet nights, fueled perhaps by alcohol and the prevailing music of the time, Joseph had made inappropriate advances towards Sheila. Learning of this, I no longer felt comfortable staying at the Bull Hotel alone, especially with the prospect of continuing to work with Joseph.
        
        After discussing our options, Sheila and I decided to seek another live-in position elsewhere, using the services of the same agency we were familiar with. Sheila's father arrived, and after explaining our plans to him, he welcomed me to join them once I was free from my obligations at the Bull Hotel. He offered to transport Sheila's belongings, while she would follow him on their Lambretta. With the arrangements made, we bid farewell to the Bull Hotel, embarking on a new chapter in our lives.<br></p>

        </div>
        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">I arrived at the Red Lion cottage after tendering my resignation at the Bull Hotel. The Red Lion Cottages were situated just outside Slough, in the quaint village of Stoke Green. The village boasted a pub, the Red Lion, a corner store, and approximately eight cottages lined up together, each detached with beautiful long gardens in front. Some of the cottages were adorned with vines around their doors, exuding a charming ambiance that, even in my teens, I couldn't help but appreciate.

          Sheila's father resided in number 6, a cottage with a perfectly manicured lawn that resembled those found on bowling greens flawlessly level and vibrant green, not a weed in sight. Henry Kelly, Sheila's father, was a gardener by profession, tending to the grounds of the Sir Howard Vyse Estate just across the road from the cottages. The estate boasted a splendid array of old oak trees and sycamores, with a vegetable garden teeming with produce of every variety. Henry was among the dedicated gardeners responsible for nurturing the horticulture on the estate, and many of the cottages' occupants were fellow employees.
          
          Inside, the cottages were surprisingly modern for their age, with small back gardens featuring flourishing bushes of Forsythia in full bloom. Each cottage comprised a kitchen, living room, upstairs bathroom, and two bedrooms, all tastefully decorated and invitingly cozy.
          
          I arrived just after midday and was warmly greeted by Sheila, who had prepared a delightful lunch. Henry soon joined us, and over lunch, we shared stories of our experiences and aspirations. I found an instant connection with Henry; his warmth and positivity uplifted both of us. And so, another chapter of my life begins, alongside someone I cherish deeply, with hopes that our affection is mutual.<br/><br/>
        After taking some time for ourselves, it was time to seek employment. Our opportunity came in the form of London Airport. We turned to the agency we had used before and found positions for both of us at London Airport, conveniently located not too far from Slough and easily accessible.
        
        At the time, London Airport consisted of the newly built Queens Building, handling all domestic and continental flights, and London Airport North, a temporary location until the full Heathrow Airport was established. The buildings at London Airport North were reminiscent of old wartime munition huts or buildings, with round roofs that sloped down to the ground like half-moons. Inside, there were lounges, restaurants, shops, and a cocktail bar. I found employment there, knowing it was temporary until proper facilities were constructed at Heathrow Airport.
        
        Air travel in those days was reserved for the elite - celebrities, politicians, and business personnel, all dressed impeccably. The seating areas offered an unrestricted view of the aircraft coming and going, including Constellations, Bristol Britannias, DC 9s, Boeing Stratocruisers, De Havilland Comets, and later, Boeing 707s.
        
        For me, seeing the well-dressed ladies with their lovely hats and gentlemen in their suits felt romantic. Working in the cocktail lounge, serving drinks, allowed me to engage in light conversation with the patrons, sparking my desire to travel.
        
        Sheila took on a position as a waitress in the Queens Building cafeteria, where she was kept busy due to the increasing number of flights to continental and domestic airports from the new London Heathrow Airport. Eventually, she was offered a position at Pinewood Studios, which she promptly accepted. I remained at London Airport North until its closure in 1959.
        <br>
        As the hands of time swept by, the depth of my feelings for Sheila grew stronger with each passing day. It was a realization that led me to take a leap of faith and propose marriage.<br/>To my delight, she accepted, and on the 26th of November 1959, we exchanged vows in a humble ceremony attended by only twenty cherished guests from each of our families.<br/>Given Sheila's Catholic faith and her desire for our wedding to be celebrated in a Catholic church, I knew I would need to convert to Catholicism. Upon moving in with Sheila and Henry at Stoke Green, I was afforded the opportunity to undergo a six to eight-week instruction period with a Catholic priest, culminating in my baptism and formal entry into the Catholic Church.
        
        Growing up without any religious affiliation, I had always felt a vague sense of longing for some form of spiritual connection. In my youth, I had experimented with attending Sunday School gatherings, as well as trying out the Boys Brigade and Scouts, but I struggled to reconcile myself with the rituals and prayers involved.
        
        During our time working at the Bull Hotel, Sheila invited me to accompany her to Mass. Wanting to support her and strengthen our bond, I agreed. Not far from the Bull Hotel was an old Friary Monastery at Aylesford, run by Carmelite friars. The monks, dressed in white cassocks, conducted the Mass in a stark, austere chapel devoid of icons or plaques typically found in Catholic churches. These early morning Masses became a routine for us, offering me a glimpse into the Catholic faith.
        
        I found the instruction sessions I received to be enlightening and engaging, often engaging in in-depth discussions with the Italian priest who oversaw my conversion. His perfect English, coupled with a charming Italian accent, left a lasting impression on me. Perhaps it was this experience that sparked my love for Italian cuisine, as I immersed myself in the culture. Ultimately, my baptism into the Catholic faith not only allowed me to marry Sheila but also set me on a fulfilling path in life, raising five children within the embrace of the Church."
        
        Our honeymoon, albeit modest, was filled with the promise of adventure. Henry, a dear friend, lent us his car, and we set off for Cornwall, with its rugged coastlines and windswept cliffs. Despite the chilly November weather casting a somber hue over the landscape, our hearts were warmed by the sheer joy of being together.
        
        Dreams of venturing to far-off lands like Gibraltar or Ireland danced in our minds, but the reality of our joint bank balance tethered us to more modest aspirations. Yet, in the embrace of each other's company, the allure of distant shores faded into insignificance.<br/>
        
        While my time at the airport had been fulfilling, I knew it was time to spread my wings further. The hospitality industry, with its myriad facets, beckoned me to explore new horizons. Each establishment offered a unique tapestry of experiences, a canvas upon which I could paint the colors of my expertise and passion.
        
        As I contemplated the next chapter in my professional journey, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. What wonders awaited me in this ever-changing landscape of hospitality?<br/>
        
        With Sheila still dedicated to her work at Pinewood Studios, the opportunity for us to embark on a new adventure presented itself in the form of live-in positions at The White Swan Hotel in Stratford-upon-Avon for the summer season. It was an offer too enticing to pass up, promising not only a change of scenery but also an opportunity to expand our repertoire in the realm of catering while bolstering our savings.
        
        We eagerly accepted the proposition, viewing it as a stepping stone towards our shared aspirations. Packing our bags, we prepared for the journey ahead. Thankfully, we still had the trusty Lambretta at our disposal, and with Henry's helping hand to load our belongings, we set off on the road to Stratford-upon-Avon.
        
        As the countryside rolled by, anticipation bubbled within us, mingling with a hint of nervous excitement. What adventures awaited us in this quaint town steeped in history and culture? Only time would reveal the treasures hidden within its cobblestone streets and timber-framed buildings. But one thing was certain: together, Sheila and I were poised to embrace every moment of this new chapter in our lives.<br></p>

        <h3 class="subtitle-section"><strong>Stratford-upon-Avon</strong>the home of William Shakespeare and theatre a market town with more than 800 years of history, containing not only many buildings that survive today and would have been familiar to Shakespeare, but also a thriving community offering a wide variety of leisure, accommodation and shopping experiences. So take a moment to have a look around the site!<a href="https://visitstratforduponavon.co.uk" target="_blank">Web-Site</a>.</h3>
        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">In those days, the convenience of hopping onto a computer or mobile phone to gather information was but a distant dream. Our knowledge of <a href="https://www.white-swan-stratford.co.uk/" target="_blank">The White Swan Hotel</a> in the heart of Stratford-upon-Avon was limited to its reputation as a distinguished four-star establishment. As we arrived at the hotel, our expectations were surpassed by the grandeur of the building, its architecture steeped in the rich tapestry of history, spanning over 800 years.

          The hotel boasted 40 lavishly appointed bedrooms and a dining room that exuded classic elegance. Upon our arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the owner and managers, who provided us with a brief overview of our duties. Soon after, we were introduced to the Maitre d, the esteemed head waiter, who would be our guide through the intricacies of service in the dining room.
          
          Our training commenced with meticulous attention to detail, as we familiarized ourselves with the rhythm and protocol of the dining room. My attire for the role was nothing short of formal, adorned in a full black tailcoat with a winged collar and a perfectly tied black bow tie. Sheila, too, was outfitted in elegant attire, donning a black dress complemented by a small white apron and a dainty white hat perched atop her head.
          
          Our station was meticulously arranged, comprising three to four tables, each capable of accommodating eight to twelve guests. We were entrusted with the art of silver service, a hallmark of refined hospitality that demanded precision and grace.
          
          As the evening unfolded, we embraced our roles with enthusiasm, eager to deliver an unforgettable dining experience to each patron. However, our accommodation arrangements provided a welcomed contrast to the grandeur of the hotel. We were to reside in a private home not far from the hotel, a cozy haven where we could retreat after the rigors of service.<br/>As we settled into our new home away from home, it quickly became apparent that The White Swan Hotel was a hub for American tourists embarking on coach tours of Britain's historical landmarks. These travelers would grace our establishment for a brief two or three nights before continuing on their journey, making for a lively and ever-changing atmosphere throughout the summer season.
          
          Joining us in shouldering the workload were a couple of spirited young Irish lads, along with other local couples. Despite our disparate backgrounds, we found common ground and forged lasting friendships, often sharing convivial evenings out together. Sheila's Irish heritage served as a bridge, strengthening our bonds with our newfound companions.
          
          As time passed, we found ourselves parting ways with our beloved Lambretta, selling it to the Irish lads who had become more than just acquaintances. With our sights set on broader horizons and a desire for more extensive travel, we recognized the need for a more reliable form of transportation.
          
          In 1958/59, the advent of the Mini car presented an opportunity too good to pass up, and we eagerly placed an order for one. One late afternoon, as we were preparing for the evening service, the long-awaited vehicle arrived at our lodgings.
          
          Filled with excitement, I dashed down the stairs to meet the young lady representing the dealership, clad only in my shorts and a makeshift cardboard white dicky shirt front. In the world of service, where fresh, starched shirts were a luxury, the cardboard alternative served as a passable substitute beneath one's jacket.
          
          My impromptu attire elicited laughter from the young lady and our landlady, Mrs. Beasley, leaving me feeling both amused and slightly embarrassed. But in that moment, as laughter echoed through the halls, it was a reminder of the camaraderie and joy that colored our days at The White Swan Hotel.<br/>Amidst the bustling days at The White Swan Hotel, our routines were defined by the cadence of service. Early mornings ushered in a flurry of activity as guests clamored for breakfast, eager to fuel themselves for a day of exploration. By mid-morning, the pace would ease as sightseers ventured out, leaving us with a brief respite before the lunchtime rush.
          
          Lunches were light affairs, tailored to the preferences of our predominantly elderly American clientele. The phrase "pre-burials" lingered in the air, a gentle reminder of the stage of life many of our guests found themselves in. As the afternoon waned, we would prepare for the evening service, a time when the dining room would come alive with chatter and laughter.
          
          Despite the demands of our roles, we carved out moments to explore the charms of Stratford. Afternoons were often spent by the banks of the river Avon, indulging in the quintessentially British tradition of afternoon tea. It was during one of these leisurely outings that we encountered Alan Baines, a familiar face from our past.
          
          Alan's presence stirred mixed emotions, his affable demeanor belying past grievances. Despite Sheila's reservations, we engaged in polite conversation, though the absence of gratuities served as a stark reminder of past transgressions.
          
          Evenings found us at the local fish and chip shop, savoring the simple pleasures of good food and camaraderie. The Irish boys, with their infectious energy, added an extra layer of merriment to our nights out.
          
          As the summer season drew to a close, we bid farewell to The White Swan Hotel and its cast of characters. Though sad to part ways, we cherished the memories forged during our time in Stratford. With fond farewells and promises to keep in touch, we embarked on the next chapter of our journey, grateful for the experiences that had enriched our lives.<br></p>

        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial"> I eventually came upon an advertisement for a career opportunity at the Post Office, focusing on telecommunications. After attending several interviews, I was fortunate to secure a position as a trainee at the telephone service of the UK General Post Office. Leaving my job at the Grapes was bittersweet; while I had formed strong bonds with Mr. and Mrs. Boyes, they understood the transient nature of the hospitality industry, where gaining diverse experience often means moving on.<br/><br/>

        Upon starting my employment, I found myself part of a team of men, traveling in a well-equipped vehicle laden with various tools and equipment. Our primary responsibilities included installing telegraph poles and telephone kiosks, as well as repairing lines damaged by storms. Clad in excellent work attire, I relished the opportunity to work outdoors, despite the physical demands of our tasks. My colleagues, a group of down-to-earth individuals, differed greatly from those I had encountered on ships and in hotels. However, I quickly assimilated into their camaraderie and was eventually accepted as one of their own.
        
My time with this team served as an observation period for my work ethic and demeanor. After six months, I was selected to attend a ten day course at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Bletchley-Park" target="_blank">Bletchley Park,</a> focusing on the fundamentals of telephony.<br/> Although it was challenging for Sheila, my absence was punctuated by weekend visits home.<br/>The photo at the top of the page, showing men strapped into the top of a telegraph pole, brings back memories of a rather amusing exercise. The aim was to simulate working on wires and insulators by strapping oneself in and leaning out. However, in reality, the process of climbing several meters and securing oneself was quite different. I vividly recall my own experiences, including one where I scaled heights of over 60m, such as those along the seafront in Herne Bay, Kent. Especially in the chilly winter weather, it was an adventure that left a lasting impression.<br/>
          
Upon completing the course, I was assigned to a smaller team, comprising four men and a foreman, tasked with installing wires between telegraph poles. Fresh from my training at Bletchley Park, I eagerly took on the responsibility of climbing poles to connect wires. I cherished our outings into the countryside, where we enjoyed makeshift picnics during breaks, brewing hot tea and sharing meals.<br/>

Subsequent to another six-month stint, I returned to Bletchley Park for further training, this time delving deeper into the workings of telephony and equipment installation. Following this, I joined yet another team, this time focusing on wiring from telegraph poles to buildings where telephones were to be installed. Within weeks, I found myself installing telephones in various locations, relishing the opportunity to interact with homeowners and business proprietors, and finding a sense of fulfillment in the creative process.<br/>After several months of working with a gang on installations, I was offered a position as a solo fitter. In this role, I would be equipped with a bag of tools and apparatus and tasked with independently installing telephone extensions at various premises. Additionally, a vehicle was provided for me. <br/>However, before I could take up this position, I needed to have a valid driving license. I otained the driving test just the previuos year year After completing a driving test, the instructor remarked on an amusing incident: I had mistakenly turned left when asked to turn right, and vice versa. Despite these nervous errors, the instructor commended my overall driving ability and passed me.So obtaining the license marked another milestone in my journey towards becoming a solo fitter with the GPO (General Post Office).<br/>
Life was going well; I was enjoying my new career, while Paul was growing up as a contented baby, looked after by Sheila, who also prepared delicious meals for us all.<br/> Despite starting at the bottom of the pay scale at GPO and taking a significant pay cut, we managed decently without having to pay rent. However, we handled all the food shopping and utilities ourselves, managing to save a little along the way.<br/>But then, something happened that disrupted our peaceful life. To this day, I'm unsure of the exact cause. Sheila and her father, Henry, had a falling out. Being caught in the middle of two stubborn Irish individuals who refused to give in was challenging. My loyalty naturally lay with Sheila, and after three to four weeks of tension, it became clear that staying at Red Lion Cottages was no longer feasible.

    <h3 class="subtitle-section">Herne Bay is a seaside town on the north coast of Kent in South East England. It is 6 miles (10 km) north of Canterbury The town rose to prominence as a seaside resort during the early 19th century after the building of a pleasure pier and promenade by a group of London investors, and reached its heyday in the late Victorian era....</h3>

    <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">The situation had become too volatile. Regrettably, our little bubble burst, and we had to find a new place to live.<br/>This left me in an awkward position as I needed to appease Sheila while also finding suitable accommodation. Unfortunately, the rents where we were located were exorbitantly high, making it impractical to stay. With that, we expanded our search and found a location within our budget in Herne Bay on the Kent coast.<br/>

      I then needed to arrange an interview with my superiors at the post office to explain my situation and request a transfer to the nearest GPO depot to Herne Bay. Their initial reaction was less than enthusiastic. They expressed discontent, citing the time and money they had invested in training me for their area, which they feared would not yield a return.
      
      After about 10 days, I was called into the GPO offices where they reluctantly agreed to let me go and transfer me to the Canterbury depot. However, this meant starting over with a gang again. I expressed my reluctance, but explained that I felt I had no choice as our living arrangements were becoming untenable for my wife and son.<br/>As winter approached, we made the decision to move out. With the help of a mover, we transported our few possessions from the cottages to our new rental, an apartment situated right on the seafront.It was on the second floor, it boasted splendid views of the sea, albeit accompanied by gusty winds and chilly temperatures.
      
      During our time there, we primarily inhabited the kitchen and bedroom, reserving the lounge area for storing our food since we didn't own a refrigerator, making the space too cold for extended stays.<br/>
      
      Commute to the Canterbury depot from Herne Bay involved catching a bus departing at 5:45 in the morning, ensuring my punctuality for the 7:30 start. Following the instructions from my superiors in Slough, I integrated into a group of men, starting afresh to demonstrate my capabilities and dedication to the work. Eventually, I earned their acceptance, although it came with a disappointment as my pay rate decreased.<br/>
      
      Despite the chilly climate, there were positives to our new location. We found solace in the nearby Catholic church, where we often attended mass, pushing Paul in his pram along the promenade on sunny days. Additionally, having Brother Lionel residing in Canterbury brought us joy through his frequent visits. These occasions provided opportunities to reconnect and even introduced us to June, his wife who was a school teacher.<br>Sheila shared the exciting news with me that she was pregnant, and we were expecting an addition to the family around the month of May.<br/>Knowing this and realising that our lease on the apartment would soon expire, and with the prospect of a rent increase for the summer season looming, we felt compelled to explore other housing options. Determined to find a more permanent solution, I began familiarizing myself with the area and neighboring towns, actively searching for alternatives that would better suit our needs.<br/>
      
      While scanning rental advertisements, I stumbled upon an intriguing offer aimed at assisting individuals in purchasing their own homes. Intrigued, I contacted the advertiser and discovered that the Canterbury City Council was approving home loans for eligible applicants.<br/> This revelation prompted a shift in my mindsetÃ¢â‚¬â€from longing for a rental to considering the possibility of homeownership.
      
      After discussing the offer with the representative, we established a budget within which we could comfortably purchase a house. To my delight, I found a terraced home located at 2 Albion Place, just two streets away from Canterbury Cathedral, listed at £19,000.<br/> Following the representative's suggestion, I made an offer of £18,000, which was accepted quite a pleasant surprise!
      
      With the assistance of our modest savings and a mortgage at a low-interest rate, we were able to enter the property market and secure our own home.<br/>After completing all the necessary legal procedures and signing away what felt like my life, I officially became a homeowner. Our new residence was 2 Albion Place, nestled in a quiet cul-de-sac just a stone's throw away from the bustling city of Canterbury. This terraced house, dating back to the 1890s, boasted three bedrooms and a recently constructed bathroom with a toilet an extension that modernized the home.
      
      On the ground floor, we found a spacious front room, a large kitchen with a scullery adjacent to it, and a small back garden featuring the customary outdoor WC, typical of homes from that era. While the condition of the house wasn't flawless the front bedroom upstairs required some attention we could overlook this for the time being, as it wasn't immediately necessary for our use. The layout posed a slight inconvenience, as accessing the bathroom required passing through the third bedroom, but it was a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of owning our own piece of property assuming we could keep up with the mortgage payments, of course. <h2>Canterbury</h2>

    <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">After settling into our new home over the course of several months, and with a reduction in my wages at the post office, it became apparent that to meet our financial needs and obligations, I would need to supplement our income. Drawing on my catering experience, I embarked on a mission to secure part-time work at the various hotels in Canterbury, specifically aiming for positions in their restaurants that offered evening, weekend, and public holiday shifts.
  
    Despite facing several rejections, I eventually secured a part-time waiter position at the Slatters Hotel, which provided the additional income we required. <a href="images/Slatters-Hotel-postcard-Canterbury.jpg" target="_blank">The Slatters Hotel</a> was particularly busy, especially during the summer months, resulting in my part-time hours extending to nearly every night, weekend, and public holiday. Understandably, this schedule became overwhelming for Sheila to manage on her own.
    
    As the time for our baby's arrival drew nearer, Sheila received the news that the baby was due in just a few weeks. Given our decision for a home birth, we were visited by the local midwife, whose arrival coincided with one of her scheduled visits. It was during this visit that Sheila's water broke unexpectedly right at the front door, marking the beginning of our daughter's journey into the world.
    
    Julia was born on the 12th of May, 1962, right in our home at 2 Albion Place. I returned from work to the joyous news of becoming a father to a beautiful daughter.<br>Our household possessions were very sparse, and we were in need of several appliances: a fridge, washing machine, and dryer. In fact, we lacked many things that would make a comfortable home. Now, we have two lovely children, gifted to me and Sheila. It became my responsibility to care for them. Even with my part-time work, acquiring the funds we needed was a slow process.<br/>

    Lionel visited us regularly. He had a job with the West Piling construction firm. How he obtained such a position is beyond me; as far as I know, he was a petty officer in the catering department of the Royal Navy. Nonetheless, he repeatedly urged me to join him, promising considerable pay increases compared to my current income. When I inquired about the amount, he mentioned it would likely be double what I was earning at the time. Naturally, I asked what the catch was. His response was that we would have to travel to different sites daily until our assigned tasks were completed. Currently, the job was at the <a href="../MyStory/images/dungenesspower.jpg" target="_blank">Dungeness Power Station</a>. Lionel assured me he would provide transportation and cover the cost of travel.<br/>Knowing nothing about construction, I understood that we would be working as laborers for a flat rate of Â£20, with additional compensation for travel time and overtime. This seemed like significant money, especially considering that my current income at the GPO was £12 per week, and I earned £1.50 per hour at my part-time job. However, accepting Lionel's offer would mean giving up my career at the GPO in telecommunications.<br/>What do you do when your family needs the comfort and security of a home with the amenities they deserve? I found myself grappling with this question. I approached my superiors at the GPO and requested a pay raise, hoping to better provide for my family. However, my request was swiftly denied without consideration.

    In their stead, they suggested I enroll in night school and study for the Elementary Telecommunications Practice exam. Passing this exam would elevate me to a higher pay rate, but the course would take 12 to 18 months, with no guarantee of success.<br/>
    
    Over the next few days, Sheila and I deliberated Lionel's offer. Sheila astutely reminded me that I had left the hospitality industry to be present at home during evenings, weekends, and public holidays. Her point resonated deeply with me. Thus, with a heavy heart, I made the difficult decision to tender my resignation to the GPO and join Lionel's team.<br/><br/>As Lionel had informed me, we were assigned to work at the Dungeness Power Station, a duty that lasted for many weeks. Our mornings began early, with a one-hour drive to reach the station. Despite the long hours, I was grateful to be back home in the evenings. Some Saturdays offered overtime opportunities, which we eagerly seized, but we always cherished Sundays and public holidays spent with our family.

    Our task at the station involved arranging templates for the bases of the large pylons that would eventually carry power to the national grid.
    
    During the Easter holidays, we organized Julias baptism, anticipating the arrival of visitors from Sheila's hometown of Blackburn Auntie Kitty and Uncle Bill, who graciously agreed to be Julias godparents. Recognizing our limited space, they stayed at Slatters Hotel instead of with us at 2 Albion Place. Despite our humble accommodations, we did our best to extend hospitality with whatever resources we had at the time, even though I had only recently started working at the power station.<br/>
    Having family around us was a joy, and Kitty and Bill were delightful guests. However, Sheila later mentioned that Kitty had not been impressed with 2 Albion Place, which left a lasting impression on me.<br/>We continued to work at the power station for several months. It was certainly an eye opener to be working on such a large project. With working at the power station it really helped with my cash flow and we were able add to our comfort in the home. <br/>After the working at the power station we had a new assignment which took us to the outer suburb of London which was about another 30 mins to our travelling time. Lionel was still our transport, but things were getting a little disjointed 
    As Lionel was become unreliable by picking the team up late which made us late for signing on in the mornings and one day running out of petrol on the motorway. With each one of us showed our disappointment with him he told us that he has had enough of this job and is going leave.<br/>Of course, this situation left me very upset and unsure of what to do next. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming, but at the time, I felt I had burned my bridges with the Post Office. Returning to Slatters Hotel was not an ideal solution for me, as I was unhappy about giving up my position at the Post Office, despite the financial benefits. Ultimately, I made that choice for the money and for the well-being of my family.

    In search of some clarity, we decided to visit Mum at Claire House in Dover. During our conversation, she mentioned that the cross-channel ferry company I previously worked for had a new ship launching this summer and was looking for crew. I made a few inquiries with the company, and they were open to me applying for a position on the new ship.
  
    Now, the challenge was that we were living in Canterbury. Mum and I also discussed a new housing development in Whitfield, just a couple of miles away from her place. We decided to check it out and found semi-detached, low-set houses for sale. If we could sell our home in Albion Place, there was a possibility we could afford one of these new houses, as the prices were manageable.</p>

<h3 class="subtitle-section">
The History of Whitfield, Kent
The village of Whitfield has grown so that it is now physically connected to urban Dover, Kent, yet it has kept its own identity and sense of place. The central core of modern Whitfield was, however, not the original heart of the village; the original settlement was sited at Church Whitfield to the east. Pineham, located to the east of Church Whitfield is a small rural hamlet that is often considered part of the Whitfield community. It contains a small handful of farms and houses..</h3>
<p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">We promptly placed 2 Albion Place on the market, and it sold very quickly, yielding a nice little profit. This profit significantly helped us purchase a new semi-detached, low-set house, just like the one in the recently taken photo above. The new home wasn't quite ready for us to move in, so we rented a place for three months while the finishing touches were completed on 42 Allison Crescent.<br/>Albion Place sold quicker than we anticipated, and although we had arranged rental accommodation for several months' time, we decided not to lose the sale and let it go through. We managed to store most of our home's contents at Clare House, where there was considerable unused space under some stairs.

In the meantime, we found a temporary solution for our housing needs. Just outside of Dover, on the way to Folkestone, there was a pub called The Plough Inn, which had a paddock with caravans for holiday hire. We acquired one of these caravans to live in while waiting for our rental home to become available.

During this period, while living in Canterbury, we purchased a knitting machine for Sheila. She was already skilled at hand knitting, and we thought we could make a small income by creating baby-wear with the machine. We took the knitting machine to the caravan. It was summer, and Paul and Julia spent their time playing outside in the field while I was at work. Sheila would set up the knitting machine and start knitting.

It was quite amusing to return home the following day and see our caravan rocking as Sheila operated the knitting machine, pushing it from left to right. I can only imagine what the people around us thought was happening inside the caravan!
During this time, Sheila informed me that she was expecting another child, adding to the excitement and anticipation of our new chapter. Alongside this news, I signed up to join the crew of the<a href="https://www.doverferryphotosforums.co.uk/mv-free-enterprise-i-past-and-present/" target="_blank" onMouseOver="window.status='Free Enterprise 1'; return true" onMouseOut="window.status=' '">Free Enterprise 1</a>and began working on this ship.<br/> By 1960s, the ferries were crossing the channel year-round, providing regular, year-round employment. This new job brought stability and new opportunities for us as we settled into our new home and adjusted to the rhythm of life in Whitfield. With the arrival of our new baby on the horizon, we embraced the changes and looked forward to the future.<br/>During this time, Sheila informed me that she was expecting another child, adding to the excitement and anticipation of our new chapter. Alongside this news, I signed up to join the crew of the Free Enterprise 1 and began working on this ship. By 1963, the ferries were crossing the channel year-round, providing regular, year-round employment. This new job brought stability and new opportunities for us as we settled into our new home and adjusted to the rhythm of life in Whitfield.

On the 19th of February, our daughter Kathryn was born, making me a proud father of a son and two daughters.<br/> With the addition of Kathryn and my steady employment, I began thinking about finding a larger home to accommodate our growing family. As the new development in Whitfield progressed, we noticed that additional homes, including three-bedroom and detached houses, were being built nearby.

We spoke to the developer to see if we could secure one of these new homes when they were built. His response was quite positive, indicating that we could get a little more than we paid for Allison Crescent. Armed with this knowledge, we approached a real estate agent to confirm the potential selling price of Allison Crescent. The agent reiterated that we were in a good position to sell Allison Crescent for a profit. With this confirmation, we signed an agreement to purchase a three-bedroom detached home, subject to selling Allison Crescent.
This move promised more space and comfort for our expanding family, marking another significant milestone in our lives.<br/>Eventually, we moved into our new three-bedroom home at 46 Mayfield Road. This was a good move, especially as Sheila was expecting another child. We joked that we would have to stop moving, as each move seemed to coincide with an addition to our family. Both of us were thrilled with the news and secretly hoped for a boy this time!<br/>Everything was going well with work; in fact, I was promoted to Second Steward, relieving the Chief Steward. Settling into our new home, we felt like we were truly living the dream. The steady progress in my career and the comfort of our growing home brought a sense of stability and happiness to our lives. We looked forward to welcoming the new baby and continuing to build our future together.<br/>Phillip's birth on my birthday, February 18th, 1965, should have been a joyous occasion, but it was overshadowed by a distressing encounter with the midwife. Returning home from several trips across the channel, I found the midwife tending to Sheila, who had opted for a home water birth. The memory of her callous behavior still haunts me. She handed me a newspaper parcel, instructing me to dispose of itâ€”it was the afterbirth. Confronting her, I found Sheila and our newborn son in the bathroom, Sheila not looking well at all. The midwife dismissed my concerns, accusing me of neglecting Sheila for drinking. It was a deeply upsetting experience, one that neither Sheila nor I had anticipated.<br/>We managed to enroll Paul into a Catholic infants school in Dover, where he had to take a bus into town and back each day. After accompanying him a couple of times, he insisted on going alone. We cautiously followed him out of sight for the first few days, but he proved to be quite mature for his age and handled it well.<br/>
As I transitioned as 2nd Steward on the new ship <a href="https://www.doverferryphotosforums.co.uk/mv-free-enterprise-ii-past-and-present/" target="_blank">Free Enterprise II</a>, which commenced service from Dover to Zeebrugge on March 17th, 1966, everything seemed to be going well.<br/> However, on May 24th, 1966, the National Union of Seamen called for a strike, throwing a wrench into our plans.

Despite my employer paying above the wage threshold, we were still required to participate in the strike. This was particularly worrisome with four children and a mortgage to pay off, especially since I had recently secured a loan to build a garage. Despite these financial pressures, Sheila and I remained steadfast in our desire to immigrate to New Zealand. However, our plans had been thwarted in the past due to the unavailability of shipping bookings, particularly for pregnant women.<br/>

With the strike now in full swing, we were determined to do everything in our power to secure passage on a ship, even if it meant paying our own fare. We reached out to several travel agents, hoping to find availability.

The strike dragged on for three months, causing significant hardship for seamen, especially those whose ships were stranded overseas when the strike began. The country suffered as imports and exports were severely disrupted, impacting the economy. Despite being eligible for strike pay from the union, I couldn't bring myself to accept it.<br/>

The strike was eventually broken by Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his colleagues, who denounced it as communist-backed. While the union had been infiltrated by communist elements, the damage had been done, leading to a loss of power for the union. <br/>Eventually, we all returned to work, but the experience left a lasting impact on everyone involved.
Everything seemed to be going smoothly until May 24th, 1966, when the National Union of Seamen called for a strike. Despite the company I worked for paying above the wage threshold, they still required us to participate in the strike. This was a troubling development, especially with four children and a mortgage to pay. To add to the financial strain, I had recently taken out a loan to build a garage.<br/>

Throughout all this, Sheila and I still held onto our aspirations of immigrating to New Zealand. The only thing that had held us back thus far was the lack of availability on shipping lines, especially since pregnant women were not accepted for travel. However, with the strike now in motion, we were determined to seize the opportunity. We decided to pursue every avenue available, reaching out to several travel agents and putting our names down in hopes of finding a ship with availability. We were even prepared to pay our own fare.<br/>The strike served as a catalyst for us to definitively commit to immigrating. We were convinced that our children would have better opportunities, especially regarding university education, which seemed more limited in the UK. With this in mind, we resolved to take the first available sailing we could secure.<br></p>

With the Greek flag flying from her stern, she departed New York on November 18, to the Chandris Shipyards at Piraeus to be converted to a liner for the UK to Australia and New Zealand service.

In addition both Upper and Main Decks were extended aft, replacing several Tourist Class lounges with cabins. In addition her hull was pained white with a blue ribbon

                <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">
        Receiving the letter from Sitmar Travel Agency in July 1966 was a pivotal moment for us. The offer of berths for our entire family on the SS Australis departing from Southampton on January 26th, 1967, was the opportunity we had been waiting for. Without hesitation, we accepted the offer and immediately began putting arrangements in place to prepare for our departure.
        
        Firstly, we set the wheels in motion to sell our house, ensuring that everything would be in order by the time of our departure. We also gave notice to Townsend Packing, making arrangements for our departure from our current employment. And of course, we shared the exciting news with our family, preparing them for our upcoming journey.
        
        With everything falling into place, our anticipation and excitement for the adventure ahead grew with each passing day. We were ready to embark on this new chapter of our lives and embrace the opportunities that awaited us in New Zealand.<br><br>The day before our departure from the UK we stayed at our mother. In the afternoon I went down to the Dover Priory Railway station to confirm the times and to pay for the train journey to Southampton we need to arrive at Southampton no later than 4:30pm. I booked a taxi for morning trip to the station for all & luggage in time for the train to London. Having completed this task we went home to spend the last hours with our family. 
        In the morning there were very mixed emotions when saying our good byes. The children were seemed confused as normally they did not get this much attention! Maybe Paul was more switched on to it anyway it was very emotional. 
        We arrived at the station on time for the train to London Charing Cross where we would get the connection to Southampton to arrive on time.<br/>
        However when we all arrived with lots of luggage informed the porter what we are doing he replied well this train is going to London but Cannon Street not Charing Cross. You can imagine how I felt this first stage of immigrating NZ. I was livid that I was told misinformation and paid for all us to Southampton. Anyway the station master was very apolegetic he sorted the times out and will have a taxi waiting for us to get us to Charing Cross in time for the connection to Southampton.
        <br/>On our journey to Cannon Street, at each stop, a British Rail employee would find us on the train to reassure us that the taxi would be waiting to take us to Charing Cross station. Thanks to their assistance, we made it to Southampton on time for boarding the ship.<br/>
        
        As we walked up the gangplank, an officer greeted us, asked for our names, found us on his list, and gave us our cabin number. He informed us that a crew member would show us the way to our cabin. The crew member who assisted us spoke little English, and from his attempts to communicate, I gathered that it was his first day on the Australis. In fact, it was the first day for most of the crew.<br/>
        
        We later learned that the Chandris Company had changed the registration of the Australis to Panama. Previously, it was registered in Piraeus, Greece, and as a result of the change, all the Greek crew had walked off the ship, refusing to sail under a Panama flag. This explained why so many of the crew were new and still finding their way around.</p>

        <p class="paragraph body-paragraph-tutorial">
          I don't normally read books, but being alone for these past months has led me to seek solace in the local library. Upon entering, I was struck by its great location and the vast array of books it held. I wandered through the different categories and stumbled upon autobiographies. Despite never having delved into autobiographical works before, I thought, why not? They're factual and potentially interesting.
          
          So, I selected one about a person whom I've long admired and found myself thoroughly engrossed in every chapter. This experience reignited my passion for reading. However, I couldn't help but notice that all the autobiographies available were about well-known figures—celebrities, if you will. It made me wonder, would anyone be interested in the life story of an ordinary person?
          
          Now, as the end of May 2024 approaches and I find myself at the age of 85, feeling more like 65, I've come to realize that age is just a number. Inspired by the stories I've encountered, I pondered whether my own life experiences hold any value or interest to others. Thus, while awaiting the return of my partner and in an effort to keep myself occupied, I've decided to embark on recounting my story.
          
          To anyone reading this, I wish you luck. You may find yourself either thoroughly bored or perhaps uncovering some meaningful message within my writings. Either way, I extend my best wishes to you. Good luck.<br></p>
