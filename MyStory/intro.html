I don't normally read books, but being alone for these past months has led me to seek solace in the local library. Upon entering, I was struck by its great location and the vast array of books it held. I wandered through the different categories and stumbled upon autobiographies. Despite never having delved into autobiographical works before, I thought, why not? They're factual and potentially interesting.<br/>

So, I selected one about a person whom I've long admired and found myself thoroughly engrossed in every chapter. This experience reignited my passion for reading. However, I couldn't help but notice that all the autobiographies available were about well-known figuresâ€”celebrities, if you will. It made me wonder, would anyone be interested in the life story of an ordinary person?<br/>

Now, as the end of May 2024 approaches and I find myself at the age of 85, feeling more like 65, I've come to realize that age is just a number. Inspired by the stories I've encountered, I pondered whether my own life experiences hold any value or interest to others. Thus, while awaiting the return of my partner and in an effort to keep myself occupied, I've decided to embark on recounting my story.<br/>

To anyone reading this, I wish you luck. You may find yourself either thoroughly bored or perhaps uncovering some meaningful message within my writings. Either way, I extend my best wishes to you. Good luck.
